## Context
[//]: <>
I am a student in the 2211 FE Cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design in my fifth week of Mod 1.

For this project, I was provided with an image of a potential window layout along with instructions and requirements for what the app should do. No directories or files were provided and I was tasked with building the app from the ground up, creating my own `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files.

The project was received 1/10/2022 and the base requirements were completed by 1/13/2022 after approximately  15 hours.

## Learning Goals
[//]: <>
1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
1. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
1. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Wins & Challenges
[//]: <>
### WINS:
  - Understanding how to write out the logic for the game rules to check for a win and getting it written correctly the first time! 
  - Feeling comfortable with the organization for both my HTML an CSS layouts while writing the code.
  - Understanding class to class interaction with gavascript and getting a better understanding of how event bubbling works while using an event listener on the main board. 
### CHALENGES:
  - Structuring how my classes and main files were interacting and making sure I was updating the data model and DOM correctly in the proper spots. 
  - I struggled finding a solution to prevent the user from clicking on their chosen character a 2nd time after the user and computer selections were displayed and before the board was reset.
