## Context
[//]: <>
I am a student in the 2211 FE Cohort at the Turing School of Software and Design in my fifth week of Mod 1.

For this project, I was provided with an image of a potential window layout along with instructions and requirements for what the app should do. No directories or files were provided and I was tasked with building the app from the ground up, creating my own `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files.

The project was received 1/10/2022 and the base requirements were completed by 1/13/2022 after approximately  15 hours.
